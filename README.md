## How To Compile the SRS Document

The document is written in LaTeX. If you do not have a LaTeX compiler, you can
download one [here](https://miktex.org/download).

Once you have installed the LaTeX compiler you can run
`miktex-pdflatex document.tex` inside the terminal or command prompt to create
a pdf document in the current directory. However if you are uncomfortable
working in the command line you can use a [LaTeX IDE](http://www.texstudio.org/).

Bear in mind that it will require two consecutive compiles for the table of
contents to show.
