	\section{Introduction}
	
		\subsection{Purpose}
		
		The goal of this Software Requirements Specification is to ascertain the concrete necessities that the proposed software, NavUP, should fulfil. This software, amongst other tasks, will act primarily as a navigation tool. For this reason we believe the two main interest groups are:
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Students who are search for a particular building on campus, or are investigating the many historically relevant buildings on campus.
			\item Guests to the university that require assistance finding locations.
		\end{itemize}

		\subsection{Product Perspective}
		
			\subsubsection{System Interfaces}
			
			\subsubsection{User Interfaces}
		
				There will be three main mediums through which prospective users can interact with the proposed system. These are:
				
				\paragraph{Web Interface}
				
					Users will be able to access the software through an intuitive Web Interface, and hence through any device that has an up-to-date browser.			
				
				\paragraph{Android Application}
				
					An Android application will allow the users of Android smartphones and tablets to interact with the system with a native application on their device.
				
				\paragraph{iOS Application}
		
					An iOS application, similarly to the Android app, will enable mobile Apple devices, such as iPhones or iPads, to connect to the software service.

			\subsubsection{Memory}
			
			\subsubsection{Operations}
			
			\subsubsection{Site Adaptation Requirements}
		
		\subsection{Product Functions}
		
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Successfully identify a user's current location, and plan an accurate route to another location on campus.
			\end{itemize}
